# imagizor
The Imagizor is a bash script, that download Software images and write the Images to an SD-Card or to an USB-Stick.
It can a cancels download resume, so can't a bad friend make a bad joke and cancel the download. 
This Script is the revolutionary Image writer script, it can even unpack a gz file without any help.
But the Script is in a !!Beta!! version, maybe it is not the revolutionary Image writer script, but in a while time i can say it is perfect (all data without guarantee).

You need a Formatter tool to get the maximum performance, for linux i use the shfmt foramtter you can download it here:https://github.com/mvdan/sh/releases/download/v2.0.0/shfmt_v2.0.0_linux_amd64

Now you can use the Script with the formatter to get the maximum power and when you have great ideas for the script, then you can work on it yourself

But now the question how does the script work and how it looks in action?
For these question have i prepare a example
