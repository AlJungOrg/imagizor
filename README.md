# imagizor
The Imagizor is bash script, that download Software images and write the Images to an SD-Card or to an USB-Stick.
It can a cancels download resume, so can't a bad friend make a bad joke and cancel the download. 
This Script is the revolutionary Image writer script, it can even unpack a gz file without any help.
But the Script is in a !!Beta!! Version, maybe it is not the revolutionary Image writer script, but in a while time i can say it is perfect (all data without guarantee).

You need a Formatter tool to get the maximum performance, for linux i use the shfmt foramtter you can download it here:https://github.com/mvdan/sh/releases/download/v2.0.0/shfmt_v2.0.0_linux_amd64

Now you can use the Script with the formatter to get the maximum power.
